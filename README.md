# memory-cards

<h3>DEMO: https://memory-card-game-vue.herokuapp.com/</h3>

## Features
- Opportunity to select how much card pairs you want to have in game
- Color changing design (I know, it looks awful, but at least works ðŸ˜‚)
- Timer for how much it takes for you to find all pairs
- Nice gameplay ?? Probably not ðŸ™‚

## Project development
- Used vuex store
- 4 components:
  - CardsTable
  - Card
  - Timer
  - Modal
- Random code from stackoverflow
- Ok, I'm just joking but probably shouldn't

## Screenshots

Generally I upload screenshots from projects I create, but as this project design is probably the most awful I have ever created, I won't do that
